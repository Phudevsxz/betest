JWT include 3 parts: Header, Payload, Signature

Signature = base64UrlEncode(header) + base64UrlEncode(payload) + [a token generate server secret key string] => encrypt.

How to verify: Jwt token => generate Signature from the header + payload => compare the generated signature with the signature part in token. This must be matched

JWT token is used for authentication because Web Api usually is used cross domain, which can not use cookie.
