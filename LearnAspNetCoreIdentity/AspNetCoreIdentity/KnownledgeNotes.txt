4 Essentials Parts:
	- UI: Identity.UI
	- Functionalities: Identity
	- Data Store: Identity.EntityFrameworkCore
	- Actual Database (Ex: SQL Server) : EntityFrameworkCore.Design; EntityFrameworkCore.Tools

In AspnetCoreIdentity theres some main services:
	- SigninManager: Help to verify credentials and generating security context and does Authentication
		- For Authorization, we still need to create our own custom policy and IAuthorizationHandler if needed. 
		By default It's handled by default generic AuthorizationHandler for basic by Role
	- UserManager: help us to get all user information in the database

HOW 2FA Through Email WORKS:

	- 1 User send first factor authentication is username/password to server. Server audit success then create a code
	- 2 The code will be saved into identity cookie authentication and send back to the browser. Also send the code to the email
	- 3 User will check the code in email and send it to the server. Server will compare it with the saved code in identity cookie auth
